1. Try some other data types and comparisons! Change the first variable's value to the string "5" by adding quotation marks around the 5.  Change second variable's value to the number 5 without quotation marks.

    {% hint style='tip' %}
The value of a variable is to the right of the '=' sign.
    {% endhint %}

    {% hint style='working' %}
What is the output of "What type is the first variable" when you add quotation marks around the 5? What if you change the variable in `typeof()` on line 13 to use the variable **&lt;noun_3>** from line 6?
    {% endhint %}

1. Remove the `* 2` from line 6 then change the `>` to `==`. Make note of the comparison value in the output.

1. After reviewing the comparison with `==`, change it to `===`.  How is the output different from the `==` comparison in the previous step?

    {% hint style='info' %}
`==` compares the value and does not care about the data type so a string "5" is the same as the number 5.  

`===` compares both the value and the data type so a string "5" is not the same as the number 5.
    {% endhint %}

1. Try out other variable values, different mathematic operators, or different comparison operators and see what happens.  

| Mathematic operator | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| + | Addition |
| - | Subtraction |
| * | Multiplication |
| / | Division |
| % | Modulus |

| Comparison operator | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| > | Greater than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| < | Less than |
| <= | Less than or equal to |
| == | Equality |
| === | Strict equality |
| != | Inequality |
| !== | Strict inequality |
