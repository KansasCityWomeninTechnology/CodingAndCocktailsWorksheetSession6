## Declare variables and assign values {#variables} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
You'll start practicing some JavaScript basics covered in the presentation.  We'll use an CodePen and play a variation of Mad Libs. The code to replace will look like this: **< noun_1>**.  You'll replace everything including the angle brackets so **< noun_1>** becomes **drink**.

{% hint style='tip' %}
A noun is a person, place or thing such as "pen" or "drink."

A verb is a word used to describe an action such as "make" or "become."

## Explore type comparisons and equality operators {#types} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Logical operations are the basis of computer programming. Explore types, arithmetic operations, and equality comparison.
