# Add elements to the DOM

Let's practice what we learned by adding new content to the web page. We want to finish the web page by adding names of awesome women.

1. Using Atom, declare a new array to hold the names of awesome women after the `brainSkills` array in _scripts.js_. You can use whatever variable name you want. 
   {% hint style='working' %}
<details>
<summary>

</summary> 
Type <code>const ladyDevs = [];</code>.
</details>
   {% endhint %}

1. Populate the array with names of women you met at Coding & Cocktails. If you can't remember any names, here's some awesome lady devs to use:
   * Grace Hopper
   * Evelyn Boyd Granville
   * Ada Lovelace
   * Barbara Liskov
   * Margaret Hamilton
   * Sister Mary Kenneth Keller


1. Find the declaration for the function `addDevSkill` at the top of _scripts.js_. Between the `addDevSkills` and `request` functions, declare a new function to use for writing the names of the lady devs to the DOM. Your function should look like this:
  
   ```javascript
const addLadyDev = function (ladyDev) {
}
   ```

1. Between the opening and closing curly braces of the `addLadyDev` function, type the following code to create a new list element, set the text, and add it to the DOM:
  
   ```javascript
let listItem = document.createElement('li');
listItem.innerHTML = ladyDev;
document.getElementById("fellow-ladydevs").appendChild(listItem);
   ```

1. In the `document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", ...)` function at the bottom of _scripts.js_, iterate through the new array and call the `addLadyDev` function.   
   {% hint style='working' %}
<details>
<summary>

Take a look at how you iterated over <code>brainSkills</code> and called the <code>addDevSkill</code> function. You'll do the same for <code>ladyDevs</code> array and calling <code>addLadyDev</code> function.

   {% endhint %}

1. Save your file and start atom-live-server. Do you see the names of fellow LadyDevs? Upload a picture of your web page to Slack and show off your work! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜Ž

<!-- trick markdown to give me a little space between these two sections of text -->

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _script.js_ against the answer key for your work. It might look a little different depending on spacing and names of Lady Devs.
