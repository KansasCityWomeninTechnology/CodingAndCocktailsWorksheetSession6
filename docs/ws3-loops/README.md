# Arrays and loops {#top}
In this section, we will create and populate an array and iterate through the array to add list items to the DOM.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Declaring and defining arrays {#array} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
First we'll declare an array so we can use the array data in the application. We'll also use the array length property to determine how many items are in the array.
{% include "./1array.md" %}

## Working with arrays {#loops} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
To use the array data, we need to access the array elements. We can do this by index (AKA array position) or by iterating over each item in the array. 
{% include "./2loops.md" %}

## Checkpoint <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Compare your _script.js_ against the answer key for your work so far. It might look a little different depending on spacing.  
{% include "./checkpoint.html" %}
