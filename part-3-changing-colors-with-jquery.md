### Part 3: Changing Colors with jQuery

Next we’ll practice another common interaction on web pages: changing HTML element styling triggered by an event. When the checkbox next to a drink is selected, make the background of the drink label change colors.

1. First, capture the event:

  1. Look in the _index.html_ file to find the check box elements. 
  
  We’ll need to utilize CSS attribute selectors this time. These look like `cssElement[“attribute=value”]` 
  
  Hint:[bit.ly/AttrSel](http://bit.ly/AttrSel) 
  
  Don’t know what an attribute is? Check this out: [http://bit.ly/Attribs](http://bit.ly/Attribs)

2.  Add the click event handler like we did in step 8.a.ii. Hint: [bit.ly/CnCClick](http://bit.ly/CnCClick)

   1.  Next we have to add our action:

      1.  Inside of the click event handler we need to add the function to run the action we’re going to do.  This is similar to how we created the function to run when the document is ready.
      2.  Inside of that function, this time we’re going to need the input’s parent element: the label.  **Hint:** [bit.ly/CnCparent](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CnCparent&sa=D&ust=1478465001125000&usg=AFQjCNE4INDAs5xRmmQl2TP1uUcO0N0qNg)
      3.  We only want the color to show when the box is checked. There are a few ways to do this and often changing styling you’d use the `.css()` method: [bit.ly/CnCCSS](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CnCCSS&sa=D&ust=1478465001126000&usg=AFQjCNGX4XkLprOujxC6Yb72j_nna1rLVw).  This time since we want to add and remove it we’re just going to toggle the CSS styling class using the jQuery method `toggleClass()` Hint: [bit.ly/ToggleC](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/ToggleC&sa=D&ust=1478465001127000&usg=AFQjCNE_zKIpUHHNGJONJhbO2zFA_W4qng)  We’ve already set up the highlight class for you in the **assets/styles/main.css** file.

1.  **EXTRA CREDIT:** Make clicking the &quot;Order&quot; button get the value from the name radio button input and display it in an h1 tag inside the light purple div as &quot;{{name}}&#039;s order is ready!&quot;

    1.  First capture the event on the Order button:

      1.  Select the Order button like we’ve selected the show and hide buttons above. (check out index.html to find the button’s id to select)
      2.  Add the click event handler to the button Hint: [bit.ly/CnCClick](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CnCClick&sa=D&ust=1478465001130000&usg=AFQjCNE9sKnrtJJdiDZGcwrRkpyOAwaCvg)

  1.  Next we have to add our action but this time we’re going to have to save the name value so we can use it again later.

      1.  Create your **orderName** variable.  Remember when you declare a variable you must start with the `var` keyword!
      2.  We need to capture the radio button input’s value in this variable  so let’s get it selected!  Note: we only need to store the value for the input element that is “checked.” **Hint 1:** [bit.ly/CnCRadio](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CnCRadio&sa=D&ust=1478465001132000&usg=AFQjCNFkmjVHQ0WwM9G63fZV5-bX8fqeJw) **Hint 2:** [bit.ly/CnCChecked](http://bit.ly/CnCChecked) **Hint 3:** [bit.ly/CnCVal](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/CnCVal&sa=D&ust=1478465001133000&usg=AFQjCNEOLMx1XT212cHayeyAbhTunDflNg) **Hint 4:** `var myVar = $("input:input-type:checked").method();`
      3.  Once you’ve stored the value in your variable you can check the value in Chrome’s Developer Tools Console tab using `console.log(orderName);` in your script file.  When you trigger that event the variable’s value will then be displayed to the console. **Hint:** [bit.ly/CnCOutput](http://bit.ly/CnCOutput)
      4.  Now that we have captured the value, we need to display that in our div section.  There are again multiple ways to do this: the `append()` method: [bit.ly/CnCAppend](http://bit.ly/CnCAppend)  and the `html()` method: [bit.ly/CnCHTML](http://bit.ly/CnCHTML), though one of these is a better choice than the other. Can you figure out why one of these is a better option?  Talk it over with a mentor if you aren’t sure! **Hint:** Try both options and push the order button multiple times for each to see what happens!

          1.  First select the **div** section you want to act on.  (find the id of the element in the **index.html** file and select it)
          2.  Next we’ll use append or html to add the **h1** tag and content inside the div.  See the “JavaScript String Operators” section of the JavaScript Operators page: [bit.ly/CnCOps](http://bit.ly/CnCOps) for a reminder on how to use your variable with other static text.
