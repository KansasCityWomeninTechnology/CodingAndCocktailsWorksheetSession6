### Part 1: Introducing JavaScript

In part 1 you'll start practicing the JavaScript concepts covered in the presentation.  This will be done Mad Libs style to start.  Items to be replaced will look like this: **< noun_1>**.  You'll replace everything including the angle brackets so **< noun_1>** might become **drink**.

{% hint style='tip' %}
A noun is a person, place or thing such as "pen" or "drink."

A verb is a word used to describe an action such as "make" or "become."
{% endhint %}

#### Variables, Booleans, Operators and Comparison
1. In Google Chrome, navigate to https://codepen.io/CodingCocktailsKC/pen/EmBPYM

2. In the JS editor, look for the Mad Libs items to replace. Remember these are the noun or verb text surrounded by angle brackets: **< noun_2>**.

{% hint style='tip' %}
Make sure to replace all instances of a variable with the same noun!
Make sure to remove the angle brackets <> around the text so your code will work!
{% endhint %}

3. The lower portion of the pen should display the output of your code.

4. Change the first variable's value to the string "5" and the second variable's value to the number 5.

{% hint style='tip' %}
The variable value is the portion to the right of the = sign.
{% endhint %}

5. Change the third variable to compare the two variables using ==. Make note of the comparison value.

6. Change the third variable to compare the first two variables using ===.  How is that different from the == comparison in the previous step?

{% hint style='info' %}
== is only comparing the values to each other and does not care about the data type so a string "5" is the same as the number 5.  === compares both the value and the data type so a string "5" is not the same as the number 5.
{% endhint %}

7. Try out additional variable values, different mathematic operators ( +, -, *, / ) or different comparisons ( !=, !==, ==, ===, <, > ).  


#### Calling a function with a parameter
1. In Google Chrome, navigate to https://codepen.io/CodingCocktailsKC/pen/EmBPYM

2. In the JS editor, look for the Mad Libs items to replace. Remember these are the noun or verb text surrounded by angle brackets: **< noun_2>**.

{% hint style='tip' %}
Make sure to replace all instances of a variable with the same noun or verb!
Make sure to remove the angle brackets <> around the text so your code will work!
{% endhint %}

3. The lower portion of the pen should display the output of your code.

4. Try changing the variable value or the return value of the function.
