### Part 2:  Content Slider  {#part-2-content-slider}

Next we’re going to add in a content slider on our page.  This is very useful to scroll through pictures, text, videos or any other html items on a website.  We’re also going to utilize a library for this called bxSlider.

1.  Checkout the add-slider branch and this will be our starting point for the content slider piece.  We’ve already included the bxSlider library in our project for you as well as the necessary HTML markup.  You’re going to add the interactivity!

1.  First we need to connect the bxSlider script file and CSS styling to our index.html file so everything will work!  You will find the JavaScript file and the CSS file in the assets/lib/jquery.bxslider folder.  Don’t forget one of these utilizes a script tag and the other uses a link tag! Hint: see step 1 of the “How to Install” section on [bxslider.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bxslider.com/&sa=D&ust=1478465001143000&usg=AFQjCNF_LD_iPyCbCafnDyNst5RhU0sXEQ)

1.  Look at the index.html section and see the unordered list element (ul element) with a bxslider class to see the markup for this slider.

1.  Call the bxSlider on your content.  Hint: See step 3 of  the “How to Install” section on [bxslider.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bxslider.com/&sa=D&ust=1478465001145000&usg=AFQjCNH59Q6SAJMiDPwggB3_SlRK7aSgSg)

1.  Try making some modifications to how your slider works:

1.  Change the mode of the slider to &#039;vertical&#039;. Hint: [bit.ly/bxSExample](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/bxSExample&sa=D&ust=1478465001146000&usg=AFQjCNHWOUOFLAr_2fdC9ImaS4IivSHLaQ):
2.  Add captions to your images. Hint: [bit.ly/bxSOpts](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://bit.ly/bxSOpts&sa=D&ust=1478465001147000&usg=AFQjCNGmZDRreRYpKPjKYrPddN37qdnqZA)
