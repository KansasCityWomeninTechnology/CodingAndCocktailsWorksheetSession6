### Part 3:  Content Slider

Next you'll add in a content slider to the page.  This is very useful to scroll through pictures, text, videos or any other html items on a website.  This project will utilize a library called bxSlider.

1. Checkout the **add-slider** branch and this will be our starting point for the content slider piece.  We’ve already included the bxSlider library in our project for you as well as the necessary HTML markup.  You’re going to add the interactivity!

2. First, connect the bxSlider script file and CSS styling to the _index.html_ file so everything will work!  The JavaScript file and the CSS file are located in the _assets/lib/jquery.bxslider_ directory.  

Don’t forget one of these utilizes a `script` tag and the other uses a `link` tag!

**Hint**: see step 1 of the “How to Install” section on [bxslider.com](http://bxslider.com)

3. Look at the _index.html_ file and find the unordered list element `<ul>` with a `bxslider` class to identify the markup for the slider.

4. Call the **bxSlider** on your content.  Hint: See step 3 of  the “How to Install” section on [bxslider.com](http://bxslider.com/)

5. Try making some modifications to how your slider works:

   1. Change the mode of the slider to 'vertical'. Hint: [bit.ly/bxSExample](http://bit.ly/bxSExample):
   2. Add captions to your images. Hint: [bit.ly/bxSOpts](http://bit.ly/bxSOpts)

**Congratulations!  You created an interactive website!**
